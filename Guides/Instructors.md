# ReadMe for Instructors
* Before attendees arrive, run through the entire workshop
* Additionally, you can deploy a GCP instance, stage this github repo there, and run `python3 iceBreaker.py` after configuring your GCP and Atlas details. 
* This will serve as an ice breaker like we have done in the past
* Have everyone open the page (you have it open already before you introduce the link to your GCP instance) and people can fill out what they want and see the page populate in real time with responses
* Reiterate that after walking out today, the attendees are armed with the knowledge to build this app
* To save time, it may be worth while to share your Google API key with those who cannot generate or upload theirs. Having yours there when they do the `git pull` has saved significant time
